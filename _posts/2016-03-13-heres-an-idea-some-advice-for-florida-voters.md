Look. Sometimes we all make mistakes. It is one thing to buy the wrong type of laundry detergent or royally miss the mark by buying 12 quail eggs --- that may feed like 1/3 of a person --- instead of 12 good ol' American mass produced chicken eggs.

It is an _entirely _different proposition to walk into a ballot box flip a fucking bird to both the angel and the devil sitting on your shoulders and drop a wicked deuce on your ballot by voting for Donald Trump (or is it Drumpf?).

Fuck your heart. Seriously, it can't be trusted. I mean, look at the divorce rate for Christs sakes. I know this is hard but here goes: Use. Your. Brain.

Remember. Never go full retard. And yeah, it applies to a voting booth too.

Don't let Donald Trump's charming... wait... seductive... wait... overly honest... oh wait... fuck. OK, what the fuck is wrong with you? You're really considering checking the box for this guy?
